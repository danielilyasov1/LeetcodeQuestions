Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

example1:
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.

example2:
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.

example3:
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.

solution:
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var firstMissingPositive = function(nums) {
    let min = 1
    while (nums.includes(min)) {
        min++
    }
    return min  
};
