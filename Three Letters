Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns a string containing exactly A
letters 'a' and exactly B letters 'b' with no three consecutive letters being the same (in other
words, neither "aaa" nor "bbb" may occur in the returned string).

Examples:

1. Given A = 5 and B = 3, your function may return "aabaabab". Note that "abaabbaa" would also
be a correct answer. Your function may return any correct answer.

2. Given A = 3 and B = 3, your function should return "ababab", "aababb", "abaabb" or any of
several other strings.

3. Given A = 1 and B = 4, your function should return "bbabb", which is the only correctanswer 
in this case.

Assume that:

- A and B are integers within the range [0..100];
- at least one solution exists for the given A and B.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus
of the assessment.

solution:
function solution(A, B) {
    let str=''
    if(A===0||B===0){
        return str+='a'.repeat(A)+'b'.repeat(B)
    }
    while(A>B){
        str+='aab'
        A-=2
        B--
        if(B===0)
        return str+='a'.repeat(A)
    }
    while(A<B){
        str+='bba'
        B-=2
        A--
        if(A===0)
        return str+='b'.repeat(B)  
    }
    return str+='ab'.repeat(A)
}
